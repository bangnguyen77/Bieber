        <h2>Justin Bieber Talks Gun Control Laws and Feeling Lonely</h2>
        <p><span class="title">On gun control laws:</span> "I'd probably just fix some of the gun laws. In Canada, we don't really have any guns and there's no gun violence, so that really solves it. I mean, they think that it's for protection and stuff, but it always ends up in some bozo's hand."</p>
        <p><span class="title">On feeling lonely:</span> "People would never guess that artists like myself would feel lonely, with all things that are always around us and people, but a lot of it is really surface-y, and there's no depth to those relationships. So you just end up feeling like, well, I'm connecting but I'm not feeling what I want to feel. So, that's where I ended up. I was just in a place of like searching because I felt like people weren't what I needed them to be for me. So now, I'm really surrounded by really cool people who are like, really for me, and I can really connect with [them]. I'm in the best place ever, probably [that] I've ever been in my life."</p>
